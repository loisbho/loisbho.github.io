                    I implemented a general graph package to support two clients: a shortest route finder and a version of MAKE.  The shortest route trip finder outputs directions for the shortest path between two points given a map file. The version of MAKE used the graph package to rebuild a set of targets given the prerequisites.

                    <p>For the graph package, I implemented several algorithms including directed, undirected graph, BFS, DFS, A*, Dijkstra's algorithm, shortest path, and traversal module.</p>

                    In this game, Pacman needs to locate and eat the invisible ghost given the noisy distance. The blocks of color indicate where each ghost could be.  This helps us have a better estimate of the position of the ghost.  After Pacman eats the ghost, the ghost appears in the jail, which is seen as the boxes outside. 

                    <p> My partner and I implemented algorithms for performing both exact and approximate inference using Bayes nets.  In addition, to track multiple ghosts, we implemented the joint particle filter algorithm.
